I plan on replacing this in the future
My idea behind this initial project is just to have fun with independent designs, themes, and styles for each page.
I view this as a place where I can practice when feeling inspired by something I saw or a video I found.
I'll likely also use this repo as a place to save old themes, designs, etc - a html and css library of sorts.
I do intent on creating a JS library of features in the future as a website project!
